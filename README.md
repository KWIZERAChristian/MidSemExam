# Project Description:

* This project is a simple Java application designed to manage student registration within an academic institution. It utilizes JUnit for testing, Hibernate for database interaction, and is implemented using the Java programming language.

## Functionality:

The application allows users to perform various tasks related to student registration, including adding new students, registering students for courses, and retrieving student lists for specific semesters.

### Technologies Used:

* JUnit: JUnit is employed for unit testing to ensure the correctness of the application's functionalities.

* Hibernate: Hibernate is utilized as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for database interaction, providing a seamless way to persist and retrieve data from the database.

* Java Programming Language: The entire application is developed using Java, a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and robustness.

### Project Structure:

* src/: Contains the source code files for the application.

* test/: Contains the unit test files implemented using JUnit to validate the functionality of the application.

* lib/: Contains external libraries or dependencies required by the project, such as Hibernate libraries.

#### Setup Instructions:

* Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

* Set up the database environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and configure the database connection settings in the Hibernate configuration file (hibernate.cfg.xml).

* Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

* Run the provided unit tests to verify the correctness of the application's functionalities.

#### Usage:

#### Compile and run the application.

* Interact with the application's user interface to perform various tasks, such as adding students, registering students for courses, and retrieving student lists for specific semesters.
